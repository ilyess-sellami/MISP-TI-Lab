# MISP-TI-Lab

![MISP Image](/screenshots/misp.png)


## Overview
**MISP-TI-Lab** is a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment built around **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**. This lab allows security analysts to practice **threat intelligence collection, correlation, and sharing** by simulating real-world cyber threats such as ransomware campaigns. The lab demonstrates how organizations can track, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in a controlled environment.


## Objectives
- Deploy and configure a fully functional MISP instance.
- Simulate malware event targeting a client organization.
- Collect and organize Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) including file hashes, IPs, domains, URLs, and email addresses.
- Correlate events to detect campaigns and threat patterns.
- Apply tags, galaxy clusters, and contextual metadata for efficient threat analysis.
- Provide a realistic SOC training environment for analysts.

## Features
- User role management (Admin, Analyst, Read-only)
- Event creation and IOC management
- Object and attribute grouping for contextual analysis
- Event correlation and visualization


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Lab Environment  

```bash
git https://github.com/ilyess-sellami/MISP-TI-Lab.git
cd MISP-TI-Lab
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have a **Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+)** and run the provided install script:

```bash
chmod +x INSTALL.ubuntu2404.sh
sudo ./INSTALL.ubuntu2404.sh
```

### 3. Configure `misp.local` on Your PC

Before accessing MISP from your local machine, you need to map the `misp.local` domain to your Ubuntu serverâ€™s IP address because MISP references this domain by default.

**MacOS / Linux:**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Edit your hosts file with a text editor using `sudo`:
```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
3. Add a new line with your server IP and `misp.local`:
```bash
    <your-ubuntu-server-ip> misp.local
```
4. Save the file and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).
5. Test by running (You should see responses from your server IP):
```bash
    ping misp.local
```
